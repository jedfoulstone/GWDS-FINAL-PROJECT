        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>My name is Jed and I am currently 18 years old. I was born and raised in Bristol and decided to stay here
            for university. I like to spend my freetime playing sports (specifically football), video games, going out
            to socialise with my friends and watching movies/series (my favourite genre is crime).</p>
