                        This is my first design. I wanted to go with a minimalistic design with the main focus being on
                        the balloons. I made the balloons in illustrator by outlining one of the images provided in the
                        carp task zip file. Looking back at this poster, I feel i should've made the balloon's secondary
                        colour the same shade of grey as the background instead of black.

                        This is my second design. I went with a bright theme to attract people's eyes. I cut out one of
                        the balloons from the zip file and copied to so I had two of them. I chose red and yellow
                        because they are vibrant colours and they are also featured on the actual balloon. I originally
                        wanted all the text/logos to be on an angle but the bristol logo and the date/price didn't look
                        right so I only angled the two other logos.

                        This is my third design. I went with a very minimalistic style and cut out two parts of the
                        images from the zip file. I wanted the main focus to be on the logo and details about the event
                        so I gave it a large font so it catches peoples eyes.
