        <p>My favourite part of the project would be the actual coding of the website. Although I found some parts
            challenging and looked for answers on google, or by looking at how other people wrote their code, I was
            surprised by how fast I started learning HTML and CSS. A website that really helped me was
            stackoverflow.com. I found that making the website on a windows pc is a lot easier than making it on a mac.
        </p>

        <p>The part I most disliked about this project was the CARP task. For a while, I had a lack of inspiration and
            didn’t know what to do so I left this task until the end. Although I created a lot of the assets that I used
            in the posters (the balloons and the triangle cut out of the images in illustrator) and imported it into
            InDesign, I still struggled using the program because I’ve never used InDesign before. In the future, I
            would like to avoid using InDesign. When exporting the images out of InDesign, I found that for some reason
            they wouldn’t show in my html page. I’m not sure if this was because I exported them incorrectly or if it
            was a glitch, so in the end I had to import the design from InDesign into illustrator and export it from
            there.</p>

        <p>
            When making the typography pieces, I had no plan on what design I wanted to do, but when I created my first
            design which was the axial piece, I knew I wanted to stick with the blue and white colour scheme and make
            every design all similar.

        <p>
            While following the task sheets, I found a lot of it confusing and time consuming, but I feel if I did the
            worksheets now I would easily be able to follow them with no confusion.
        </p>

            I ran into quite a lot of problems when making the website. The biggest problem I encountered was that none
            of my images or text was flexboxing even though I coded it correctly. I think this was mainly my fault due
            to the fact that I wasn’t checking if my content was laid out correctly as I coded. In the end, I decided to
            completely restart and start a new website. There was a few problems that I couldn’t overcome in the end
            such as the header for the homepage not resizing to fit the window and the footer text not completely
            showing when I resized the window.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, I found the process of making the website fun and educational. I learned a lot of things about HTML
            and CSS and I found this module the most fun so far in the uni course. The final outcome of the website
            turned out a lot different to how I had it planned out mainly due to the fact that when I actually coded the
            design that I had planned, it didn't look how I expected it to.
